		<h2>Water Your Lawn Only When Necessary</h2>

		<div class="row">

			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<%= image_tag("info/lawn") %>
			</div>

			<div class="col-sm-8">
				<p>Water your lawn only when necessary! It takes 660 gallons of water to supply a 1,000 square feet of lawn with one inch of water. This is nearly the same amount of water that you use indoors in an entire week.</p>
				<p>But wait, there's more! When should you water your lawn? Water it early in the morning or at night when the grass is already somewhat moist from the dew and temperatures are cooler. Itâ€™s much more water friendly than watering during the midday heat and ending up with dried up grass! At night it would also work extremely well because evaporation would be at a low for the day due to cooler temperatures.</p>
				<p>Mow lawns down to about 2.5 to 3 inches long. This will allow the grass to become thicker and collect more dew, which gives your lawn extra moisture. Taller, thicker lawns collect more moisture.</p>

		<h2>Hose Fixtures</h2>

		<div class="row">

			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<%= image_tag("info/hose") %>
			</div>

			<div class="col-sm-8">
				<p>Attach a pistol-type sprayer to the end of your garden hose. This device enables you to adjust the rate of flow and keep water from running during periods when you put down the hose without turning it off. Hose fixtures can also stop water from flowing entirely when you're not using them. Hoses that don't have automatic shut-off can waste up to 8-12 gallons per minute, which is a reason that you should conserve water.</p>

		<h2>Use Mulch</h2>

		<div class="row">

			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<%= image_tag("info/mulch") %>
			</div>

			<div class="col-sm-8">
				<p>Mulch reduces soil evaporation, cutting water use by 25-50% and stabilizes soil moisture. Mulch also breaks the force of rain and irrigation water hitting the ground, thereby preventing erosion, soil compaction and crusting. Mulched soils absorb water faster. Mulch prevents splashing of mud and certain plant pathogens onto plants and flowers during rain or from overhead irrigation.</p>

		<h2>Drip Irrigation</h2>

		<div class="row">

			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<%= image_tag("info/drip") %>
			</div>

			<div class="col-sm-8">
				<p>A good way to prevent over watering is to install rain or soil moisture sensors to override your automatic watering system when necessary. A rain sensor simply senses rainfall. Once a designated amount of water has been detected, it shuts down any regularly scheduled irrigation. </p>

		<h2>Collect Rainwater</h2>

		<div class="row">

			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<%= image_tag("info/drop") %>
			</div>

			<div class="col-sm-8">
				<p>Rainwater is a clean, salt-free source of water that contains many beneficial ingredients for plants. Rain can contain sulfur, potash, several other minerals and even microorganisms, all of which provide a boost to plant growth.</p>
