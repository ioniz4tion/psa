			<div class="col-sm-8">

				<p>Showering is one of the most water-intensive indoor activities. The average family uses about 40 gallons per day. That adds up to 1.2 trillion gallons in the United states with just showering. The standard showerhead uses around 2.5 gallons of water per minute. If you install a low flow head in your shower you can save up to 2,900 gallons per year. This goes for faucets also. Every step makes a difference in saving water and this is one step you can take!</p>

		<h2>Use High-Efficiency Clothes and Dish Washers</h2>

		<div class="row">

			<div class="col-sm-4 less-margin">

				<%= image_tag("info/dishwasher") %>

			</div>

			<div class="col-sm-8">

				<p>A typical clothes washer uses about 40 gallons per load, but if you upgrade to a resource-efficient one you may use as little as 15 gallons per load. This is a huge difference when you are conserving water. Dishwashers usually set themselves on how much water they are going to use each wash. </p>

		<h2>Compost Food</h2>

		<div class="row">

		<div class="col-sm-8">

		<p>Using a garbage disposal requires water and energy which makes high bills and uses fresh water, and the United States has a limited resource. This can save 150-250 gallons per month. When you are done peeling or skinning your vegetables, donâ€™t throw them down the garbage disposal: use them for compost. This is another tiny step you can take to help conserve water.</p>

		<h2>Insulate Water Pipes</h2>

		<div class="row">

			<div class="col-sm-4 less-margin">

				<%= image_tag("info/pipe") %>

			</div>	

			<div class="col-sm-8">

				<p>Insulating your water pipes inside your home can increase your water's temperature by 2 F - 4 F. This is hotter than what uninsulated pipes can deliver, and this allows water to heat up faster. This also allows your water heater to have a lower water temperature setting. This is another beneficial step you can take to help conserve water. </p>
